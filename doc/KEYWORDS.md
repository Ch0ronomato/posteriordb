Posterior keywords
==================

Below are the definition of some of the keywords used. These are tags added to posterior that we known. Hence, there might exist posteriors that should have the keyword where it is currently missing. If you see this, please file an issue and we will try to fix it.

```arm book```: Posteriors that can be found in Gelman, A., & Hill, J. (2006). Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models. Cambridge university press.

```easy```: Posteriors that can be computed with standard Stan settings (adapt delta = 0.8) without any divergent transitions for 10 000 draws and on average uses less than 100 leapfrog steps.

```slow```: Posteriors that takes more than 1h to run 1000 iterations/warmup on a standard CPU. The difficulties can be due to different reasons.

```pathfinder paper```: Posteriors used in Zhang, L., Carpenter, B., Gelman, A., & Vehtari, A. (2022). Pathfinder: Parallel quasi-Newton variational inference. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 23(306), 1-49.
