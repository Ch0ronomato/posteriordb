Posterior keywords
==================

Below are the definition of some of the keywords used:

```arm book```: Posteriors that can be found in Gelman, A., & Hill, J. (2006). Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models. Cambridge university press.

```easy```: Posteriors that can be computed with standard Stan settings (adapt delta = 0.8) without any divergent transitions for 10 000 draws and on average uses less than 100 leapfrog steps.

```slow```: Posteriors that takes more than 1h to run 1000 iterations/warmup on a standard CPU. The difficulties can be due to different reasons.

```pathfinder paper```: Posteriors used in Zhang, L., Carpenter, B., Gelman, A., & Vehtari, A. (2022). Pathfinder: Parallel quasi-Newton variational inference. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 23(306), 1-49.
